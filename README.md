# Welcome to Codecampster

[Orlando .NET Users Group](http://onetug.org) is building this project to provide an online service to help run Codecamps

We would love to hear your feedback!

This project is an educational effort to showcase .NET development on different platforms (Windows, Linux and OSX). 
As a result, the development is in [.NET Core](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/dotnetcore.html) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Because of time constraints, we're still using Microsoft SQL Server for data storage but hope to branch to more platform agnostic data stores soon.

Pointers for quick start:

1. If you're on Windows, [download and use Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-2017-rc/). 

2. Look at the appsettings.json file before you start. You should probably create a database on your local SQL Server and assign an user with dbowner privileges. Use this database and user in the appsettings.json connection string (Windows only).
